README

Please do not distribute these files.

There isn't a lot of comments, I apologize. They're really just proof-of-concept code.
It does use iffalse now, so we should be good.

Build using make:
	make

Delete all generated files:
	make clean

Run:

java MiniJavaC filename_to_compile.java

No classpath is necessary due to the expanded jars in the directory structure.
The run dumps the symbol table and the IR list.

Let me know if there are any issues.
